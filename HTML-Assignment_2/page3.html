        <h3>Semantic Elements</h3>
    </header>
    <main>
        
<p>When building web pages, we use a combination of non-semantic HTML and semantic HTML. The word semantic means <i><b>"related to
     meaning"</b></i>, so semantic elements provide information about the content between the opening and closing tags.</p>
<p>By using Semantic HTML, we select HTML elements based on their meaning, not on how they are presented. Elements such as 
    <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> are not semantic elements since they provide no context as to what is inside
     of those tags.</p>
     <p>For example, instead of using a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element to contain our header information, we could use a
         <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element, which is used as a heading section. By using a &lt;header&gt; tag instead of a &lt;div&gt;,
          we provide context as to what information is inside of the opening and closing tag.</p>
<h3>Why Use Semantic Elements?</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Accessibility:</b> Semantic HTML makes webpages accessible for mobile devices and for people with disabilities as well.
         This is because screen readers and browsers are able to interpret the code better.</li>
    <li><b>SEO:</b> It improves the website <b>SEO</b>, or <b>S</b>earch <b>E</b>ngine <b>O</b>ptimization, which is the process of increasing
         the number of people that visit your webpage. With better <b>SEO</b>, search engines are better able to identify the content of your
          website and weight the most important content appropriately.</li>
    <li><b>Easy to Understand:</b> Semantic HTML also makes the website's source code easier to read for other web developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>To better understand this, you can think of comparing non-semantic HTML to going into a store with no signs on the aisles. Since
     the aisles aren't labeled, you don't know what products are in those aisles. However, stores that do have signs for each aisle make
      it a lot easier to find the items you need, just like Semantic HTML.</p>
<p>Many web sites contain HTML code like: <code>&lt;div id="header"&gt;, &lt;div id="nav"&gt;, &lt;div id="main"&gt;, &lt;div id="footer"&gt;</code>
     to indicate header, navigation, main content and footer.</p>
